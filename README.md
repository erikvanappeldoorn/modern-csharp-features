# Modern C# Features

## Introduction

This repository contains examples of features added to the C# language since version C# 7. 

Examples are organized by file. Each new feature is demonstrated in it's own Polyglot Notebook with the filename indicating the name of the feature. In the content section of this readme file they are also organized by C# version. So C# version, Feature name, Name of the Polyglot Notebook with context about the feature and examples.

Happy Coding !
